# 🖧 LAN, MAN, and WAN

## 📌 What are they?
Computer networks are categorized by **geographical coverage** into **LAN, MAN, and WAN**.

---

## 🏠 1. LAN (Local Area Network)
- Covers a **small geographical area** (e.g., a room, office, building).
- Usually **privately owned and managed**.
- High **speed** (up to Gbps).
- Used for **file sharing, printers, internal apps**.

🔗 **Real-World Analogy**:  
LAN is like **Wi-Fi inside your home or office**.  
Everyone in the house is connected and can share stuff easily, but it doesn’t cover the whole city.

---

## 🏙️ 2. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- Covers a **city or large campus**.
- Larger than LAN, smaller than WAN.
- Often operated by **ISPs, telecom companies, or universities**.
- Medium to high speed.

🔗 **Real-World Analogy**:  
MAN is like a **city’s public transport system (metro/buses)**.  
It connects multiple small neighborhoods (LANs) across the city.

---

## 🌍 3. WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Covers a **large geographical area** (countries, continents, global).
- The **Internet is the biggest WAN**.
- Uses **submarine cables, satellites, telecom lines**.
- Slower compared to LAN but allows **global connectivity**.

🔗 **Real-World Analogy**:  
WAN is like the **global airline system ✈️**.  
It connects cities and countries together, enabling worldwide travel (data exchange).
