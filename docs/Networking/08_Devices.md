# 🖥️ Network Devices

## 📌 What are Network Devices?
Network devices are **hardware components** that connect computers, phones, and servers to build a network.  
They help in **transmitting, receiving, and directing** data.

---

## 🔑 1. Hub
- A **basic device** that connects multiple computers in a network.  
- Works at **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**.  
- Sends data to **all connected devices**, not just the intended one.  
- Inefficient and insecure.

🔗 **Analogy**: A **loudspeaker in a hall** – everyone hears the message, even if it’s meant for one person.

---

## 🔑 2. Switch
- Smarter than a hub.  
- Works at **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**.  
- Uses **MAC addresses** to send data only to the correct device.  
- Increases speed & security.

🔗 **Analogy**: A **teacher calling a student by name** – only that student responds.

---

## 🔑 3. Router
- Connects **different networks** (e.g., home network ↔ internet).  
- Works at **Network Layer (Layer 3)**.  
- Uses **IP addresses** to find the best path.  
- Provides NAT, DHCP, and firewall functions.

🔗 **Analogy**: A **traffic police officer** who directs cars to the right roads.

---

## 🔑 4. Modem
- Stands for **Modulator-Demodulator**.  
- Converts **digital signals** (computer) ↔ **analog signals** (telephone line/ISP).  
- Allows internet access over phone lines, fiber, or cable.

🔗 **Analogy**: A **translator** between two people speaking different languages.

---

## 🔑 5. Access Point (AP)
- Extends a **wired network into wireless (Wi-Fi)**.  
- Devices connect without cables.  
- Often built into routers.

🔗 **Analogy**: A **Wi-Fi hotspot** in a café – it lets you connect wirelessly.

---

## 🔑 6. Firewall (Hardware)
- A **security device** that filters traffic (incoming/outgoing).  
- Can block malicious data.  
- Works at multiple OSI layers.

🔗 **Analogy**: A **security guard at a building gate** – only lets safe people in.

## 📊 Quick Comparison

| Device   | Layer (OSI) | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Hub      | Layer 1     | Broadcasts data to all |
| Switch   | Layer 2     | Directs data to correct device |
| Router   | Layer 3     | Connects networks using IP |
| Modem    | Physical    | Converts digital ↔ analog |
| Access Point | Layer 2 | Extends wired → wireless |
| Firewall | Multiple    | Protects network from threats |
