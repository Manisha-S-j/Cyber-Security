# 🌊 Submarine Cables (Undersea Cables)

## 📌 What are Submarine Cables?
- Submarine cables are **fiber-optic cables laid on the ocean floor**.
- They connect continents and countries, carrying **most of the world’s internet and telecommunication data**.
- Despite satellites, **over 95% of international internet traffic** still goes through these cables.

---

## ⚙️ How Do They Work?
- Made of **fiber optic strands** (thin glass fibers).
- Data travels as **light pulses** through these fibers.
- Cables are protected with layers (plastic, steel wires, waterproof coating).
- Special ships **lay these cables** across the ocean floor.

---

## 📍 Why Important?
- Provide **high-speed, low-latency** internet.
- Cheaper and faster compared to satellites.
- Connects the **global economy, communication, banking, streaming, etc.**

---

## 🌍 Real-World Analogy
- Imagine the **world’s internet as a giant city**.  
- Submarine cables are like **underwater highways or bridges** that connect one city (continent) to another.  
- Without them, the internet would be slow (like relying only on helicopters 🚁 = satellites).

---

## 🔒 Security Concerns
- **Accidents**: Ships’ anchors or earthquakes can break them.
- **Sabotage**: They can be intentionally cut.
- Repairs require **special ships** and are very expensive.
