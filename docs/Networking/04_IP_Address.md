# 📝 IP Address (04)

- **Definition** → An IP address is like the *house address* of your device on a network.  
- **Purpose** → Just like the postal service delivers letters to your house, networks use IP addresses to deliver data to your device.  

---

## 🔑 Types
- **IPv4** → 32-bit (like old phone numbers, limited to a certain length).  
  - Example: `192.168.1.1`  
  - Total: ~4.3 billion addresses (but we are running out).  

- **IPv6** → 128-bit (like adding more digits to phone numbers so everyone gets one).  
  - Example: `2001:db8::1`  
  - Total: Almost unlimited addresses (future proof).  

---

## 🌍 Public vs Private
- **Public IP** → Like your *main street address*, visible to the world (given by your ISP).  
- **Private IP** → Like your *apartment number inside a building* (used only within your WiFi/LAN).  

  - Reserved Private Ranges:  
    - `10.x.x.x`  
    - `172.16.x.x – 172.31.x.x`  
    - `192.168.x.x`

## 📊 IPv4 vs IPv6
- IPv4 → Old system, addresses are running out.  
- IPv6 → New system, practically infinite addresses.  
- Analogy → IPv4 is like using **6-digit pin codes**, but when cities grew, we needed **12-digit pin codes (IPv6)** to cover everything.

## 💡 Example
- Your Laptop → `192.168.1.5` (private, inside home).  
- Your Router → `103.45.76.12` (public, known to the internet).  
- Together, they let your laptop talk to the internet safely.

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy
- Think of sending a **parcel**:  
  - **IP address** = House address (where to deliver).  
  - **MAC address** = Name tag on the door (unique identity).  
  - **Port number** = Apartment/room number (specific application inside your computer).  

Without IP addresses, your data would be *lost like a parcel with no address*.
