# 🌐 Introduction to Computer Networking

Networking is the backbone of the digital world. Every message you send on WhatsApp, every website you browse, every email you deliver — all of it relies on **computer networks**.

👉 **Definition:**  
A computer network is a collection of **two or more devices** (computers, servers, smartphones, IoT devices) connected together so they can **share resources, exchange data, and communicate**.

## 🔹 Why Do We Need Networking?
- To **share resources** (files, printers, internet).  
- To enable **communication** (email, messaging, video calls).  
- To allow **data exchange** (cloud storage, databases).  
- To build the **internet** — the world’s largest network.

Without networking, computers would remain **isolated machines** with no way of talking to each other.

## 🔹 How It All Started?
- In the **1960s**, computers were huge and expensive, mostly used by military and research organizations.  
- The U.S. Department of Defense funded a project called **ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)**, the **first real computer network**.  
- Over time, ARPANET evolved into today’s **Internet** 🌍.
