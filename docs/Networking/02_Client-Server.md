# 02 Client-Server Architecture  

## 📌 Definition  
Client-Server Architecture is a network design where the **client** requests resources/services, and the **server** provides them.  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. Client sends request (e.g., opening a website in browser).  
2. Server processes the request.  
3. Response is sent back to client.  

## 🔑 Key Points  
- Centralized server.  
- Multiple clients can connect.  
- Improves security and management.
